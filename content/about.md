# Long Story Short
In modern world, all technology around us seems black box to us. It could be a gift, also could be a weapon. It's a waste for me to use computer to only watch youtube, because it's a sword that nobody sees, an assassin hiding in the crowd. 

In world of stories, I want to be a knight, superhero, as in the world of cyber, I want to be a pentester.

# What Education Taught Me
Going through a bachelor in Computer Science and master in Cyber Security, I am disappionted at the cost-effective of the courses. To be frank, it's not what I want, most of them bored me. 

I think it's better for me to learn on internet rather than paying huge money on learning how to pass the exam. Especially to the perspective of pentesting, red teaming, which are practical, real-life scenario, exciting, daily changing... 

Thanks to the boredom of school, I learned what I truely want. This website is to record my fighting journey and maybe possibly, help you in some way.
